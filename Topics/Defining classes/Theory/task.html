<h2>Defining classes</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>When programmers are writing a real program, they use standard classes as building blocks. However, they often need to declare new program-specific classes to better represent the domain area. In this topic, we will see how you can create a <strong>custom class</strong> in Java.</p><h5 id="declaring-new-classes">Declaring new classes</h5><p>A new class is declared with the <code class="language-java">class</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a keyword is a reserved word that has a special meaning in the programming language. | These words cannot be used as variable names in your own program. Keywords are part of the syntax, a set of rules that define how a program needs to be written in order to be valid. For instance, the keyword 'final' is used to declare a constant variable, indicating that its value cannot be changed after being initialized. However, the use of keywords can sometimes make code less readable due to boilerplate code, hence their usage should be standardized in a project.">keyword</a> followed by the name of the class. For example, this is how you would create a class named <code class="language-java">Nothing</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-java">class Nothing {
    // empty body
}</code></pre><p>A class <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the term 'body' refers to the section of a class, method, or lambda expression that contains the executable code. | It is enclosed by curly braces and represents the actions that will be performed when the class, method, or lambda expression is invoked. The body is where developers define the behavior of objects, class, or the whole program, and it can contain any valid Java code.">body</a> can include <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11523" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A field in Java is a variable that is declared within a class, and it is used to store data. | It can have any type, including primitive types (such as int, float, boolean, etc.) and class types (even the same class). A class can have multiple fields, and they are used to store the current state or data of the instance of the class. Fields can be accessed and modified through methods, and they are a crucial part of object-oriented programming in Java.">fields</a>, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A method in Java is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. | It is a fundamental unit of functionality in Java, similar to a function in other programming languages. Methods are used to encapsulate code, making it reusable and modular. They can take inputs in the form of parameters, and return outputs. Methods can also be overloaded, allowing for multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. They are a crucial part of object-oriented programming, as they represent the behavior of objects and classes.">methods</a>, and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3535" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, constructor is a special method that initializes a new object of a class. | It has the same name as the class, no return type, and is automatically invoked when an instance is created using the keyword new. Constructors set values to the fields when the object is created, and can take parameters for initializing fields with specific values. They can also invoke other constructors within the same class, allowing for more complex initialization logic.">constructors</a>. <strong>Fields</strong> store <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9723" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, data is separated into two main categories: primitive types and reference types. | Primitive types are built-in data types provided by the language, such as int for integers, and they are represented as lowercase keywords. Reference types, on the other hand, represent objects and are typically created using the new keyword, which allocates memory for the object and initializes the variable. String is a commonly used reference type, and it can be instantiated using either a constructor or a literal, like Hello, World! .">data</a>, <strong>methods</strong> define behavior and <strong>constructors</strong> allow us to create and initialize <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a new object is created through the new keyword, followed by a class constructor. | The object is an instance of the class, and it has its own state, which is stored in fields. The object's behavior is defined by the methods in the class. When a new object is created, memory is allocated for it on the heap, and the object's constructor is called to initialize its state. The object can then be used and manipulated throughout the program.">new objects</a> of the class. Not all Java classes have fields and methods so sometimes you will see classes without them.</p><p>The source code of a class is placed in a <code class="language-java">.java</code> file. Usually, a source code file contains only one class and has the same name as that class, but sometimes a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3635" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a file is a representation of a file or directory in a file system, managed by the File class in the java.io package. | It can be used to perform various operations like reading, writing, and manipulating files and directories. The File class treats a directory as a file, and provides methods to check if a file exists, to create a new file or directory, to delete a file or directory, and to rename a file or directory. It also provides methods to get information about a file, such as its name, path, and last modified time.">file</a> can contain more classes.</p><h5 id="writing-fields">Writing fields</h5><p>A <strong>field</strong> is a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their values can be accessed and modified throughout the program.">variable</a> that stores data. It may have any type, including <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3532" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a primitive type is one of eight built-in data types provided by the language. | They are represented by keywords and are not objects, unlike reference types. Primitive types are divided into groups based on their meaning, and each group operates similarly but has different sizes and ranges of values. The most commonly used primitive type is `int`, which represents an integer number. Java also provides several types for integer and fractional numbers, which are often used in arithmetic expressions.">primitive types</a> (int, float, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3516" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, boolean is a data type that has only two possible values: true and false. | It is also known as the logical type and is commonly used to represent something that has only two opposite states, like on or off, yes or no. Variables of the boolean type are often used to build logical expressions using logical operators, such as not, and, or, and xor. These operators allow for straightforward comparison of numeric values and can be seamlessly integrated into mixed expressions with arithmetic operators.">boolean</a> and so on) and classes (even the same class).
